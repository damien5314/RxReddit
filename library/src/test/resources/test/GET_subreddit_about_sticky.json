We kept them intentionaly uncompressed in order to make the definitions easier and for users to see clearly what was actually new and what was just reworded.\n\nWe learned a lot from the trial in ways we can patch things up, if we do decide to implement these rules, it will take some kind of different form. \n\nHowever, we need to discuss and vote and decide what we want to do, and your feedback will help.\n\nThank you.",

It works for the majority. \n\n&gt; The majority of users are in favor of these title rules.  They just upvote the content despite the titles.\n\nHow do you know that?  All we can say is that they're upvoting the submissions.  That tells me that the submissions are fine.\n\n&gt; People are voting for the titles, not the content, and the titles aren't the subject of this subreddit.\n\nThen all titles should be the same so only the content can be judged.  The subreddit would basically be Flickr.\n\n&gt; I still want better posts.\n\nWhenever I see people complaining about /r/pics titles, I look at their post history.  Most of them don't post in /r/pics, or if they do it's not more than once or twice a year.  They hate the submissions but they aren't willing to contribute.  You'll see the same in this thread from the users and mods supporting it.  \n\nMy suggestion: if you don't like the content, submit better content.  ",
