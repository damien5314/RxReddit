The team will create guidelines to both preserve the integrity of reddit and to maintain reddit as the place where the most open and honest conversations with the entire world can happen.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third, as a redditor, I\u2019m particularly happy that Steve is so passionate about mobile.  I\u2019m very excited to use reddit more on my phone.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a closing note, it was sickening to see some of the things redditors wrote about Ellen.

Steve\u2019s great challenge as CEO [2] will be continuing the work Ellen started to drive this forward.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[1] Disagreements are fine.

I&amp;#39;m currently employed as a Software Test Engineer, looking to move to a position in the Bay area (from Philadelphia) where there are a lot of major tech companies and startups. My current company is an established tech consulting firm with many clients across the US. I was really hoping to move to a new client within my current company because they provide good relocation benefits (paid corporate movers, hotel stay for 2 weeks in new location), but seeing as I&amp;#39;ve been looking for a new project for nearly 2 months now with no luck, I am not sure what to do. My &amp;quot;deadline&amp;quot; for allocation to a new project was early this month, but so far no one has contacted me about potential termination if I do not find a new project. They are still paying me full salary (~$65k with benefits and a yearly bonus), so I am afraid that eventually they would end up terminating me if I don&amp;#39;t find something soon.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week I decided to post my resume on a couple job sites to see what kind of calls I would get from outside agencies &amp;amp; companies. Well of course, they started flooding in. Most of them have been offers to pursue contract positions. The problem is, I don&amp;#39;t know what I should be asking for in order to make it worth it to leave my current company. I have 3 years experience right now with my current company between two clients, and have gotten good feedback from my previous managers; I am confident that I could perform well in a contract position. That said, negotiating contracts, purchasing my own health, dental, vision, and life insurance, doing my own taxes, and moving across the country by myself is very intimidating.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think my current company would offer me much of a pay raise for moving to a client in California. Part of my salary is a cost-of-living adjustment, but I think they would only bump it up by about $5k for moving from PA to CA. This might not even be enough to survive out there, which is also why I&amp;#39;m considering moving to another company\/contract. That said, I also have 3 weeks vacation saved up, and I&amp;#39;m supposed to be getting a bonus at the end of March. I&amp;#39;m not sure how much of this I would receive if I decide to leave.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Questions - How much should I ask for from a recruiter looking to place me on a contract position in the Bay area, with no benefits? How much are benefits worth? Should I wait to be terminated from my current position to try to get my vacation pay &amp;amp; yearly bonus before seriously pursuing an independent contract or full-time position?&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR - I currently work for a large consulting firm, making full salary while in-between projects and afraid they will terminate me soon if I can&amp;#39;t find a new project (targeting Bay area). I have been contacted by many recruiters looking to place me with clients, mostly contracts, but I&amp;#39;m not sure how much benefits are worth, or how much I should be looking to bill considering the risk involved and my prior experience.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Part of my salary is a cost-of-living adjustment, but I think they would only bump it up by about $5k for moving from PA to CA. This might not even be enough to survive out there, which is also why I'm considering moving to another company\/contract. That said, I also have 3 weeks vacation saved up, and I'm supposed to be getting a bonus at the end of March. I'm not sure how much of this I would receive if I decide to leave.\n\nQuestions - How much should I ask for from a recruiter looking to place me on a contract position in the Bay area, with no benefits? How much are benefits worth? Should I wait to be terminated from my current position to try to get my vacation pay &amp; yearly bonus before seriously pursuing an independent contract or full-time position?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading.\n\nTLDR - I currently work for a large consulting firm, making full salary while in-between projects and afraid they will terminate me soon if I can't find a new project (targeting Bay area). I have been contacted by many recruiters looking to place me with clients, mostly contracts, but I'm not sure how much benefits are worth, or how much I should be looking to bill considering the risk involved and my prior experience.",
