The basic idea is this: *an object should be responsible for doing its job, not for figuring out how to go out and gather all the necessary stuff to create itself*. This is very closely related to the [Single Responsibility Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle), because if a class doesn't separate out doing its job from finding the stuff necessary to create itself, then it really has two different responsibilities. And that leads to code that is inflexible and hard to work with.\n\nTo make an analogy, suppose you are going to make a salad and you write a SaladMaker class like this:\n\n    class SaladMaker {\n      Carrots carrots;\n      Lettuce lettuce;\n\n      SaladMaker() {\n        GroceryTrip trip = new GroceryTrip().buy(\"carrots\").buy(\"lettuce\");\n        trip.execute();\n        carrots = trip.get(\"carrots\");\n        lettuce = trip.get(\"lettuce\");\n      }\n\n      void prepare() {\n        lettuce.chop();\n        carrots.slice();\n        Bowl bowl = new Bowl().add(lettuce).add(carrots);\n        bowl.toss();\n      }\n    }\n\nThis works OK. It gets a salad made, which was the goal.\n\nNow suppose you decide you're going to make a carrot cake. You build a similar-looking CarrotCakeMaker class. You decide to make a meal with salad and carrot cake. You notice that you made two trips separate trips to the same store for no apparent reason. Something doesn't seem right about that.\n\nNot only that but what if you want to change how you acquire vegetables? Maybe you want to go to the farmer's market, but only for the vegetables and not for other groceries. Do you really want to change every class that could ever use a vegetable to be farmer's-market-aware? Why should *getting* carrots be so tightly coupled with *using* carrots? Why should someone who needs a vegetable be so concerned about how to get them? That should be separated out so they can concentrate on what they're good at.\n\nSo, the single responsibility principle says you should split that functionality out to somewhere else and be left with one responsibility:\n\n    class SaladMaker {\n      Carrots carrots;\n      Lettuce lettuce;\n\n      SaladMaker(Carrots carrots, Lettuce lettuce) {\n        this.carrots = carrots;\n        this.lettuce = lettuce;\n      }\n\n      void prepare() {\n        lettuce.chop();\n        carrots.slice();\n        Bowl bowl = new Bowl().add(lettuce).add(carrots);\n        bowl.toss();\n      }\n    }\n\nAnd of course you'll have to create a class to do the shopping. And to keep the inventory of stuff you've bought. Maybe a Shopper class.\n\nNow the second part. If you're convinced of the benefit of separating out creation of objects, now you just need to find a way to do that conveniently. That is where dependency injection frameworks come in. Creating the Shopper class is likely to be kind of a boilerplate thing, with a lot of uninteresting code to create things, figure out what needs what, and pass objects around to the things that need them.\n\nA dependency injection framework tries to do all that as automatically as possible. It gives you a mechanism to express that vegetables come from grocery trips, and grocery trips require cars, and cars require car keys and a tank of gas, and so on. It understands graphs of dependencies, and it knows how to create things and pass them to the places that need them. It will essentially generate boilerplate code for you, for example by using reflection to detect constructors, then using argument types and/or other info to figure out what to create and pass to the constructor.\n\nSo, dependency injection is essentially all about separating out creation responsibilities from classes and putting that under the care of a framework. It makes it easier to stick to the practice of keeping that separate, and it makes sure it's all done in a more or less standard way.", "edited": 1408777960.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me give a two-part explanation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first part of the argument is the hard part.

It has been such a cool way to connect with her and so much fun for me.  Now we're taming dogs, making roller coasters, and soon (hopefully) we'll have the potions and spells figured out.  So, I wanted to take time to say thank you to everyone that gave us awesome, awesome advice on where to start.\n\nThank you a million:\n/u/ArtisanVirgil\n/u/RatherNerdy\n/u/Riztonium\n/u/DragonShiryu2\n/u/billyK\n/u/Benjaphar\n/u/aithusah\n/u/YoungArcher13\n/u/mr_ent\n/u/wdjm\n/u/Newmow\n/u/WColt\n/u/Koala_eiO\n/u/baneful64\n/u/ManipulativeOrg\n/u/grand_mind1\n/u/Zekeman963\n/u/Craftlords\n/u/YoshiBacon\n/u/ManipulativeOrg\n/u/darknesscrusher\n/u/ohyeahclearly\n/u/Yirggzmb\n/u/BreeZaps\n/u/Crayton\n/u/Xvenia\n/u/Rubisk\n/u/Trevorisabox\n/u/tiles_\n/u/Axium723\n/u/gomotion100\n/u/Mikashuki\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "3kgk66", "from_kind": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NicePerson69", "media": null, "score": 314, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 51, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r05i", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "saved": true, "removal_reason": null, "stickied": false, "from": null, "is_self": true, "from_id": null, "permalink": "/r/Minecraft/comments/3kgk66/a_very_sincere_thank_you_to_rminecraft/", "locked": false, "name": "t3_3kgk66", "created": 1441948978.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/3kgk66/a_very_sincere_thank_you_to_rminecraft/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "A very sincere Thank You to /r/minecraft", "created_utc": 1441920178.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "ups": 314}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.fantasyfootball", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "fantasyfootball", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLEASE NOTE THAT THE FOLDERS WILL BE UPDATING DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY.

I use a &lt;a href=\"http://www.footballguys.com/05vbdrevisited.htm\"&gt;Value Based Drafting&lt;/a&gt; approach to calculate the player value for each projection, and then average those values to get a final number. The standard deviation of those value projections are used to determine tiers. A key component of value based drafting is establishing the baseline player, which I set based on &lt;a href=\"http://www.rotoworld.com/articles/nfl/41100/71/draft-analysis\"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;. Auction values are calculated using &lt;a href=\"http://subscribers.footballguys.com/2006/06tremblay_auctionpricing.php\"&gt;this method&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;#39;s new this year?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I learned how to use macros, so my personal workload is dramatically reduced. Previously I had to manually add projections, now Excel does it for me. Progress! On the sheet side I&amp;#39;ve tweaked a few things. Specifically I added the team, changed tiers to a shading system (odd tiers are gray, even tiers are white), changed ADP to show round and pick, and added performance from last year. I also removed relative rank as I feel the historical data is more useful. I also added some schedule info for the top ranked D/STs and a helpful chart for counting bye weeks. Also stuff is colored now. If you hate it, blame &lt;a href=\"/u/434InnocentSpark\"&gt;/u/434InnocentSpark&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do the columns mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Player Name (Depth):&lt;/em&gt; The name of the player, and in the case of the RB and WR columns where they are in the depth chart according to &lt;a href=\"http://gridironexperts.com/nfl-depth-charts\"&gt;Gridiron Experts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TM/BW:&lt;/em&gt; The player&amp;#39;s team and bye week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ADP:&lt;/em&gt; The player&amp;#39;s ADP based on an average from FantasyPros. The format is the round the player is taken in and then the draft pick in that round.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;#/#/P:&lt;/em&gt; This is how the player did last year for a given position each week. The first two numbers represent a weekly rank in a position (0.5 means the top 50% of a position, typically used for 1 position slots such as QB and TE). P stands for played; the number of weeks the player actually played assuming a 16 week season. For example in the 12 team, 0PPR, 2RB sheet the column would be 1/2/P and Jamaal Charles has the numbers 8/9/14. That means that in 2014 using that scoring and roster setting Jamaal Charles was a RB1 a total of 8 times, equal to or better than a RB2 a total of 9 times (including the RB1 weeks), and played a total of 14 games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;VAL:&lt;/em&gt; Player value. The average value of multiple projections relative to a baseline player (numbers shown in the title bar). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SDV:&lt;/em&gt; Standard deviation. This is the standard deviation of the projections used to establish the player value. Look at this as an indicator of the uncertainty of a player&amp;#39;s projection; the greater the standard deviation the less cohesive the projections are on player value. If the value has a positive or minus sign next to it, that reflects a significant bias in the values. Bias means a disproportionate number of projections are higher or lower than the mean.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS:&lt;/em&gt; Positional Scarcity. The percentage of player value remaining in that position once that player (and all players above him) are drafted. This is the means by which you can determine the opportunity cost of selecting one position over another. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;$:&lt;/em&gt; Auction value assuming a $200 budget. If your budget is different just multiple everything that isn&amp;#39;t $1 by the difference in price (so if your budget is $400 then multiple everything by 2). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;$ DV:&lt;/em&gt; The standard deviation of the player&amp;#39;s projections translated to a dollar amount using the same PTS:$ ratio that was applied to the auction values.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are tiers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tiers are established by looking at players whose average projected value is within one standard deviation of the top player in a tier. Projections are notoriously unreliable (the top experts are lucky to be right 60% of the time), so players who are stacked within the same tier should be considered roughly comparable in value.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will you share the original data file?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nope. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you do a sheet for my 13 player 2QB/1RB/3WR/2FLX/TE/DST/2PK league with 0.314 PPR and 9 PPTD?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes. Click on the custom request link above and I&amp;#39;ll do my best to get the sheet done for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is awesome! These sheets help me win my league last year, and you deserve a tip! How can I throw money at you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I run a fantasy football charity league called &lt;a href=\"http://www.youcaring.com/the-winning-charity-of-the-2015-cheating-for-charity-league-381976\"&gt;Cheating4Charity&lt;/a&gt; that raised $3496 over the last two years. Over 10% of the proceeds were from generous Redditors giving me tips as a way of saying thanks for the sheets. I&amp;#39;m doing it again this year.

It requires a lot of work, but it&amp;#39;s on my to-do list.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;#39;s the best way to use this? Which categories should I pay attention to the most?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ADP is used to determine where a player is typically going and whether or not he&amp;#39;s over/under drafted at that position relative to other players with similar values. The real meat of the sheet is value, tier, and positional scarcity. What I like to do is start off with value, and see which players are available within each position that have similar value. Standard deviation is important here to get a sense of how much value overlaps; a difference of a few tenths of a point isn&amp;#39;t significant enough to matter. I look at tier to get a sense of how many players are &amp;quot;clumped&amp;quot; together and see if I can&amp;#39;t get value later on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The historical numbers are helpful for figuring out how a player did last year, and whether or not you&amp;#39;re looking at a player with a high floor or a low ceiling. Obviously this is a purely historical perspective, so drafters should be wary of players who might have changed teams or who have either gained or lost competition. I find it particularly useful for quarterbacks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Positional scarcity is the big one. That shows how much value is remaining in each position after a player is taken. At that point you want the player with the lower PS, because there&amp;#39;s less value remaining once that player is gone. This will also give you a sense of just how much value an individual player takes from the &amp;quot;pool&amp;quot; of points for each skill. For example Gronk is projected to take up 1/4 of the value of all tight ends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/3d0du4/beersheets_draft_example_1_10_team_1_ppr/\"&gt;Draft Example 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/3h0co9/beersheets_a_drafting_example/\"&gt;Draft Example&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"/u/B4ugh\"&gt;/u/B4ugh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/3cdxdp/customizable_beersheets_tool_july_2015_v_10_snake/\"&gt;Customizable BeerSheets Tool&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"/u/AFKennedy\"&gt;/u/AFKennedy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/3gmanr/csg_fantasy_football_spreadsheet_v34_w_visual/\"&gt;CSG 2015 Fantasy Football Spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"/u/CanadianSandGoggles\"&gt;/u/CanadianSandGoggles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/3e3d46/elbobertos_custom_cheatsheet_and_auction_value/\"&gt;An Awesome Custom CheatSheet Generator&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"/u/elboberto\"&gt;/u/elboberto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.borischen.co/2015/08/2015-fantasy-football-draft-kit-standard.html\"&gt;Super Awesome Tiers Done By Someone Far Smarter Than Me&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"/u/Prayes\"&gt;/u/Prayes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "**PLEASE NOTE THAT THE FOLDERS WILL BE UPDATING DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY.
