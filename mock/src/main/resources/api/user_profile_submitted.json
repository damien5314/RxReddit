I have experience with issue tracking software (HP ALM, Rally, Trac, JIRA) and experience implementing end-to-end test plans. The e-commerce solution was very complex, involving managing dependencies from multiple SOAP-based web service endpoints. For these endpoints I developed an internal tool in PHP to take a list of inputs, and output data from the endpoints for test data auditing purposes. I also developed a browser extension with Crossrider to automate certain repetitive processes for our manual testers (site cookie retrieval and form-filling, mainly) which increased productivity for testers significantly.

They need a million reasons to hire someone, but not a single reason to pass them up. I don&amp;#39;t mind this reality when I am applying to companies blind. This situation, though, I seriously don&amp;#39;t know how this is possible.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I applied to this company mid-July. Recruiter from the company called me the next week saying he is interested in seeing what I can do, and if I might find a position within one of their teams which matches my skill sets. I admitted I have not done a technical\/programming interview before, and he ran through a list of subject areas in which I should prepare myself. He said a lot of their applicants take 1-2+ months to prepare in all of these areas; he wanted to make sure that when I do commit to the interview, that I represent myself in the best possible way, and knock it out of the park.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me clarify, I applied for a job which is a combination of my skill sets from my professional experience (QA Software Engineer) and my personal development projects on Android. I was not entirely confident in my experience as an Android developer, having never done it professionally, but after taking the time to polish up my projects, study algorithms, and practice programming questions for over 2 months, I am very confident that I could fulfill the role to which I had applied.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did nothing but study on the train, at lunch, in the evenings, on the weekends, whenever I possibly could. I studied the company&amp;#39;s products, their GitHub, their blog, everything. I can write a MergeSort faster than most people can use the restroom. I know the answer to any question anyone would want to ask about my resume. I updated my portfolio website and audited my social networking profiles. I was ready.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I email the recruiter back incredibly anxious, but ready to finally see if I have what it takes to get the job. A couple hours later, I get a response saying he passed my profile along to their QA manager, who decided she was not interested. Heart falls out of my chest.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never had what it takes to get that job, that much is clear. I was beginning to get suspicious after applying to 13 companies since receiving the call from the recruiter, none of which have responded with as much as an email. But having this interview to look forward to, that was keeping me going. I was so confident that if someone gives me the chance to prove myself, after all of this preparation, there&amp;#39;s no way I could fail. And they wouldn&amp;#39;t even give me the light of day.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s nothing I can do at this point, that much I know. Stuff happens, and this is a very competitive company, I just wish they had a little more tact when communicating with their applicants.
